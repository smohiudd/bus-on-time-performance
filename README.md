### Calgary Transit On-Time Performance

Using data released as part of the Canadian Urban Transit Association "Data Blitz" I created a system wide [visualization of bus schedule deviation](http://saadiqm.com/bus-on-time-performance/) for Calgary Transit buses. The analysis and visualization help us understand how well certain bus routes perform and potentially where to focus improvements.

You can find the blog post about this work [here](https://saadiqm.com/2020/01/05/bus-schedule-deviation-visualization.html).
